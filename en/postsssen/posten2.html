    <h2>"Türkiye’s Quantum Computing Journey: A Glimpse into the Technology of the Future"</h2>
    <p><em>Publication Date: December 31, 2024</em></p>

    <p>Quantum computers, by offering computational power beyond that of classical computers, have the potential to revolutionize many fields—from scientific research and artificial intelligence to drug development and security applications. So, what path is Türkiye taking in this area? Here is an overview of Türkiye’s approach to quantum technologies and its current standing.</p>
    
    <h2>WHAT IS QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY?</h2>
    <p>Unlike classical computers, quantum computers use “qubits” instead of “bits.” Thanks to their ability to exist in both the 0 and 1 states simultaneously, qubits can solve complex problems in parallel. This technology holds the capacity to transform industries such as finance, healthcare, and energy. For example, it could enable rapid data analysis in financial markets for better investment decisions, accelerate genetic analysis and drug discovery processes in healthcare, and contribute to improved energy efficiency and sustainable energy solutions in the energy sector. The rapid computational capabilities of quantum computers mean they may have the capacity to solve many of the world’s problems in the future.</p>
    
    <h2>TÜRKİYE'S QUANTUM COMPUTER AND THE GATEWAY TO THE FUTURE</h2>
    <p>Recently, an exciting news report aired on television regarding the quantum computer developed in Türkiye. This special feature showcased not only Türkiye’s strategic steps in this field but also the technological infrastructure built using local resources. The importance of quantum computers for our country is increasing, enabling Türkiye to keep pace with global innovations in this domain. This development is seen as a major step not only for the scientific community but also for the nation’s competitiveness in global technology. The computer, which simulates qudronic structures and quantum entanglement, holds the potential to deliver groundbreaking applications in artificial intelligence, defense, and materials science. Moreover, the report highlighted this as part of Türkiye’s efforts to e
